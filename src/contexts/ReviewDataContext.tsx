I am however very unsatisfied about the lack of response or service I receive now that my handbag strap broke after only 1,5 years, The local shop can not help and refers me to the customer service. Customer service just does not react on the 2 emails I have send. I would dare to say this is extremely poor for a brand that sells his products at such a high price. I will think twice next time I want to buy something. I am especially very disappointed on how they treat customers, next to the fact that the product just does not have the quality I thought it would have based on the price they ask.",
